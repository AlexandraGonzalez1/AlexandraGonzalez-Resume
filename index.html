        <div class="subheading mb-5">Musician/Singer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a very talented musician. Throughout my entire life, I have dedicated myself to the art of singing, songwriting, and performing songs. Every day I strive to improve my music skills. I have spent the last five years learning how to play the ukulele. For the past seven years, I have practiced playing the piano and I have been able to teach myself how to play the instrument well enough to sight-read advanced sheet music on the fly. However, the instrument I am the best at is my own voice. I have been singing my entire life. I am a soprano who has spent years perfecting multiple different styles of singing from choral to jazz to musical theater to pop. Any style that is requested of me, I will be able to perform. <br><br>

        Throughout high school, I performed in musical theater as well as the choral and jazz singers. This meant I was singing practically every day of the week. There was always a piece of music that I could practice to perfect. This could be for the upcoming football game, a choir competition, or the upcoming musical of the year. I spent nearly every day in the choir practice rooms sitting by the piano plucking out my notes with a metronome so that I would be as perfect as possible when it came time to showcase my talents. By the time I had graduated, I had been known as the singer around my school and many of my peers believed that I was to work in the music industry as a talented singer after graduation. <br><br>

        In college, my musical experience skyrocketed. By moving closer to Los Angeles, I instantly was able to make connections with people in the music industry and they exposed me to an entirely new world. I learned how to produce, songwriter, and how to release music. My college chamber singer and music theory classes helped me discover new limits of what can be defined as music and what music can be and I applied that to my own. Through the many hours I spent in the practice rooms in the art building of my school, I became the best soprano in my section and an affluent singer whom many of my peers would come to me for help in their own musical endeavors. In April 2023, I released my first song "Rhythm of Us" with help from my friend, Dean. He produced it while I provided the vocals and lyrics. Currently, I am working on an EP "Seasons" that I will be releasing at the end of summer 2023.
